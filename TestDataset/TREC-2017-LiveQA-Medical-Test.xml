				<ANSWER> Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and
					Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a
					shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of
					rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease. </ANSWER>

				<ANSWER> Syphilis
					If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA.
					Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine.
					Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health.
					Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.
					Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.
					All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis can spread very easily in the primary and secondary stages.

				<ANSWER> Antibiotic Regimen. Oral antibiotic treatment cures nearly all uncomplicated urinary tract infections, although the rate of recurrence remains high. The following antibiotics are commonly used for uncomplicated UTIs:
					* The standard regimen is a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, commonly called TMP-SMX (Bactrim, Septra, generic). TMP-SMX combines an antibiotic with a sulfa drug. A single dose of TMP-SMX is sometimes prescribed in mild cases, but cure rates are generally lower than with 3-day
					regimens. Allergies to sulfa are common and may be serious.
					* Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin, generic) is another first-line option. It is usually taken daily for 5 days.
					* Fosfomycin (Monurol) is not as effective as other antibiotics but may be used during pregnancy. Resistance rates to this drug are very low.
					* Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, also called quinolones, are only recommended for UTIs when other antibiotics cannot be used. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro, generic) is the quinolone antibiotic most commonly prescribed. Quinolones are usually given over a 3-day period. Pregnant women should not take these
					drugs.
					* Other antibiotics may also be used, including amoxicillin-clavulanate cefdinir, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime-proxetil. These drugs may be prescribed when other antibiotics are not appropriate. They are usually given in 3 - 7 day regimens.

				<ANSWER> Types of Group A Streptococcal Infections
					Cellulitis and Erysipelas

					Cellulitis is inflammation of the skin and deep underlying tissues. Erysipelas is an inflammatory disease of the upper layers of the skin. Group A strep (streptococcal) bacteria are the most common cause of cellulitis and erysipelas. To learn more visit the Medline Plus cellulitis site (link is external)
					or visit the MedlinePlus erysipelas site (link is external).

					Impetigo

					Impetigo is an infection of the top layers of the skin and is most common among children ages 2 to 6 years. It usually starts when bacteria get into a cut, scratch, or insect bite. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus impetigo site (link is external).

					Scarlet Fever

					Scarlet fever - or scarlatina - is a bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus or "group A strep." This illness affects a small percentage of people who have strep throat or, less commonly, streptococcal skin infections. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus scarlet fever site (link is
					external).

					Severe Strep Infections

					Some types of group A strep bacteria cause severe infections, such as

					Bacteremia (bloodstream infections) - To learn more visit visit the MedlinePlus sepsis site (link is external).
					Toxic shock syndrome (multi-organ infection) - To learn more visit the MedlinePlus toxic shock syndrome site (link is external).
					Necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease) - To learn more visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention necrotizing fasciitis site (link is external).
					Strep Throat

					Many things can cause that unpleasant, scratchy, and sometimes painful condition known as a sore throat. Viruses, bacteria, allergens, environmental irritants (such as cigarette smoke), chronic postnasal drip, and fungi can all cause a sore throat. While many sore throats will get better without
					treatment, some throat infections - including strep throat - may need antibiotic treatment. To learn more visit the MedlinePlus strep throat site (link is external).

					The sources of disease caused by group B strep bacteria are unknown. Group B strep bacteria are common in the gastrointestinal tract (the part of your body that digests food, including the stomach and intestines) of men and women and may be a source of some infection.

					Types of Infection and Symptoms
					Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. Below are common diseases caused by group B strep bacteria in adults and their symptoms.

					Bacteremia and sepsis (blood infections) symptoms include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Low alertness
					Pneumonia (lung infection) symptoms include:

					Fever and chills
					Cough
					Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing
					Chest pain
					Skin and soft-tissue infections often appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that may be:

					Red
					Swollen or painful
					Warm to the touch
					Full of pus or other drainage
					These skin infections may also be accompanied by a fever.

					Bone and joint infections often appear as pain in the infected area and might also include:

					Fever
					Chills
					Swelling
					Stiffness or inability to use affected limb or joint
					Rarely in adults, group B strep bacteria can cause meningitis (infection of the fluid and lining surrounding the brain and spinal cord).

These studies referred to refractive errors in children (n = 2), cataract (n = 1), age-related macular degeneration (n = 3) and Grave ophthalmopathy (n = 1). The data available were insufficient to establish conclusive
					relationships between ETS and these eye diseases.
					CONCLUSION:
					Very scarce data exist in the literature on the effect of ETS on diseases of the eye. It seems appropriate that ETS should be included in future studies addressing the effect of smoking on eye disease.

				<ANSWER> Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus.
					The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts. </ANSWER>

			<ReferenceAnswer aid="TQ12A2">
				<ANSWER>
					A molar pregnancy is caused by an abnormally fertilized egg. Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, all of the fertilized egg's chromosomes come from the father. Shortly
					after fertilization, the chromosomes from the mother's egg are lost or inactivated and the father's chromosomes are duplicated. The egg may have had an inactive nucleus or no nucleus.

					In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes remain but the father provides two sets of chromosomes. As a result, the embryo has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This can happen when the father's chromosomes are duplicated or if two sperm fertilize a single egg.

					Pressure palsies are most commonly the result of environmentally acquired physical compression of peripheral nerves. The most common are carpal tunnel syndrome with compression of the median nerve at the wrist, peroneal pressure palsy with compression of the superficial peroneal nerve at the fibular
					head, and ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. The signs and symptoms of compression neuropathy in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the same as those of the acquired type. Thus, HNPP is part of the broad differential diagnosis of both compression neuropathies

				<ANSWER>
					Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of many common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.

					To help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:

					Physical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.
					Blood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that
					drop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.

					You may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.

					Biopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a
					laboratory.

					If you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may
					advise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.

					Imaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:

					Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is
					conducted in a tube-shaped machine.
					Doppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.
					Positron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.
				</ANSWER>
				<AnswerURL> http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20023109 </AnswerURL>
				<COMMENT> Asking for help is usually interpreted as asking about treatments, but in this case, answers about confirming the diagnosis are also relevant. </COMMENT>
			</ReferenceAnswer>
			<ReferenceAnswer aid="TQ14A2">
				<ANSWER>GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.

					The high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be
					reduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.

					Actemra (tocilizumab) was approved May 2017 by the FDA to treat adults with giant cell arteritis.

				<ANSWER> Is fibromyalgia hereditary?
					Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D.
					Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families.
					The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia.
					In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families.
					Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.

				<ANSWER>That's why it can take a long time to go from fibromyalgia symptoms to a fibromyalgia diagnosis.
					Fibromyalgia can't be easily confirmed or ruled out through a simple laboratory test. Your doctor can't detect it in your blood or see it on an X-ray. Instead, fibromyalgia appears to be linked to changes in how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals.
					Because there is no test for fibromyalgia, your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis. Because a genetic factor appears to be involved in fibromyalgia, your doctor may also want to know if any other members of your immediate family have experienced similar symptoms.

				<ANSWER>Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. Some studies have shown that it affects 20% of school-age children. However, most experts believe this figure is high due
					to changing definitions of normal childhood behavior. It may also possibly have racial, cultural, and gender biases.

					This behavior typically starts by age 8. However, it may start as early as the preschool years. This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.
					Symptoms include: Actively does not follow adults' requests; Angry and resentful of others; Argues with adults; Blames others for own mistakes; Has few or no friends or has lost friends; Is in constant trouble in school; Loses temper; Is spiteful or seeks revenge; Is touchy or easily annoyed.
					To fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.

					The pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level. The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities.
					Children with symptoms of this disorder should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist.
					The best treatment for the child is to talk with a mental health professional in individual and possibly family therapy. The parents should also learn how to manage the child's behavior.

					Medicines may also be helpful, especially if the behaviors occur as part of another condition (such as depression, childhood psychosis, or ADHD).
					Some children respond well to treatment, while others do not.

				<ANSWER> Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow
					by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as
					hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.
					The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as
					a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include
					abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.
					Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition
					and almost always appear in childhood.
					Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.

				<ANSWER> The resistance of C. freundii to antibiotics in 1999 (n = 10), compared with the period from 1996 through 1998 (n = 26), increased 66% for ciprofloxacin, 36% for ticarcillin/clavulanate, 70% for piperacillin/tazobactam, and 62.8% for piperacillin, but remained uniformly susceptible to
					imipenem/cilastatin and the new fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). This increase in resistance was attributable to the use of third-generation cephalosporin instead of first-generation cephalosporins.  </ANSWER>

				<ANSWER>Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.

					1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact.
					2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and
					presenilin-2 (PS-2).

				<ANSWER>The majority of dementia is not inherited, but this depends very much on the particular cause of dementia. Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the
					gene is needed in order to inherit the disease.

					If you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited. Most cases of Alzheimer's disease

				<ANSWER>Some people who have sleep apnea might benefit from surgery. The type of surgery and how well it works depend on the cause of the sleep apnea.
					Surgery is done to widen breathing passages. It usually involves shrinking, stiffening, or removing excess tissue in the mouth and throat or resetting the lower jaw.
					Surgery to shrink or stiffen excess tissue is done in a doctor's office or a hospital. Shrinking tissue may involve small shots or other treatments to the tissue. You may need a series of treatments to shrink the excess tissue. To stiffen excess tissue, the doctor makes a small cut in the tissue and
					inserts a piece of stiff plastic.
					Surgery to remove excess tissue is done in a hospital. You're given medicine to help you sleep during the surgery. After surgery, you may have throat pain that lasts for 1 to 2 weeks.

				<ANSWER>A focused workup of chronic diarrhea may yield a specific diagnosis, including diarrhea-predominant IBS (dIBS), functional diarrhea, diabetic diarrhea, bile acid-induced diarrhea, and microscopic colitis. Ideally, therapeutic decisions are specifically tailored to target the underlying
					pathophysiology, including, for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess the role of diet and
					medications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered.

				<ANSWER> You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.
					Only certain body fluids-blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk-from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle
					or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth.
					In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.

					HIV can be transmitted by contact between infectious fluids and bleeding cuts or open sores in the skin. However, healthy intact skin does not allow HIV to enter the body and provides an excellent barrier against the virus.
					Non-sexual transmission is rare. The rare circumstances where non-sexual transmission has occurred typically involve medical settings or accident scenes where there is a very large volume of blood exposure or a needle stick.

				<ANSWER> Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop
					chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once
					the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.
					Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.

				<ANSWER> The major hazards of methadone are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, systemic hypotension. Respiratory arrest, shock, cardiac arrest, and death have occurred.

					The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not suffering severe pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable.

					Other adverse reactions include the following: (listed alphabetically under each subsection)

					Body as a Whole
					asthenia (weakness), edema, headache

					Cardiovascular
					(also see WARNINGS: CARDIAC CONDUCTION EFFECTS) - arrhythmias, bigeminal rhythms, bradycardia, cardiomyopathy, ECG abnormalities, extrasystoles, flushing, heart failure, hypotension, palpitations, phlebitis, QT interval prolongation, syncope, T-wave inversion, tachycardia, torsade de pointes,
					ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia

					Digestive
					abdominal pain, anorexia, biliary tract spasm, constipation, dry mouth, glossitis

					Hematologic and Lymphatic
					reversible thrombocytopenia has been described in opioid addicts with chronic hepatitis

					Metabolic and Nutritional
					hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, weight gain

					Nervous
					agitation, confusion, disorientation, dysphoria, euphoria, insomnia, seizures

					Respiratory
					pulmonary edema, respiratory depression (see WARNINGS: RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION)

					Skin and Appendages
					pruritis, urticaria, other skin rashes, and rarely, hemorrhagic urticaria

					Special Senses
					hallucinations, visual disturbances

					Urogenital
					amenorrhea, antidiuretic effect, reduced libido and/or potency, urinary retention or hesitancy

					Maintenance on a Stabilized Dose
					During prolonged administration of methadone, as in a methadone maintenance treatment program, there is usually a gradual, yet progressive, disappearance of side effects over a period of several weeks. However, constipation and sweating often persist.

				<ANSWER> If you abruptly stop taking prednisone or taper off too quickly, you might experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms:

					Severe fatigue
					Weakness
					Body aches
					Joint pain
					Prednisone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. A gradual reduction in prednisone dosage gives your adrenal glands time to resume their normal function.

					The amount of time it takes to taper off prednisone depends on the disease being treated, the dose and duration of use, and other medical considerations. A full recovery can take anywhere from a week to several months. Contact your doctor if you experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms as you are
					tapering off the drug

					body may not have enough natural steroids to function normally. This may cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, weakness, slowed movements, upset stomach, weight loss, changes in skin color, sores in the mouth, and craving for salt. Call your doctor if you experience these or other unusual

				<ANSWER>
					Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.

					EIB is common in patients with chronic asthma, who frequently experience flare-ups while exercising. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.

					Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma
					If you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.

					Your symptoms may include:
					* Wheezing
					* Tight chest
					* Cough
					* Shortness of breath
					* Chest pain (rarely)

					Triggers
					People with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through
					your nose, triggering asthma symptoms.

					Air pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.
					Even the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These
					include:
					* Hiking
					* Baseball
					* Golf
					* Walking
					* Leisure biking

					Because cold, dry air can make symptoms worse, as can activities that require continuous exertion, it is recommended that individuals with EIB avoid sports like:
					* Cross-country skiing
					* Running
					* Soccer
					* Basketball
					* Hockey

				<ANSWER> Fortunately, having asthma, even exercise-induced asthma, doesn't have to keep you out of the game. In fact, as many as one in 12 Olympic athletes take asthma medication.

					The trick is to make sure asthma is well controlled with medication and to choose your activity carefully. Some are good choices, others may be more of a challenge. ...
					One recent study found that adults who walked three times a week for 12 weeks actually improved asthma control and fitness levels without provoking an attack. ...

				<ANSWER>Bundle branch block is a condition in which there's a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage may occur on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the left or the right side of the bottom chambers
					(ventricles) of your heart.

					Bundle branch block sometimes makes it harder for your heart to pump blood efficiently through your circulatory system.

					There's no specific treatment for bundle branch block itself. However, any underlying health condition that caused bundle branch block, such as heart disease, will need to be treated.

					In most people, bundle branch block doesn't cause any symptoms. Sometimes, people with the condition don't even know they have a bundle branch block.

					For those people who do have signs and symptoms, they may include: Fainting (syncope); Feeling as if you're going to faint (presyncope)

				<ANSWER> Success Rates for Catheter Ablation at the University of Michigan
					Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in 70-75 percent of patients with a single procedure. When the procedure is repeated in patients who still have atrial fibrillation after the first procedure, the overall success rate is approximately 85-90 percent.
					Persistent atrial fibrillation can be eliminated in approximately 50 percent of patients with a single procedure. In about 30 percent of patients who undergo ablation of chronic atrial fibrillation, the atrial fibrillation is replaced by a different kind of short circuit referred to as "left atrial
					flutter." These patients are treated temporarily with medications and the left atrial flutter sometimes goes away on its own within a few months. If it does not, you may need a second catheter ablation procedure to eliminate the flutter. In these cases, the overall success rate is approximately
					75-85 percent. If the atrial fibrillation has been persistent for more than 1-2 years, almost all patients will require more than one ablation procedure before a normal heart rhythm is restored.

				<ANSWER> Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.

					Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further
					HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.

					Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated
					blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.

					Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is
					much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

					Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.

					Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent
					HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.

				<ANSWER> Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections
					How you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the
					skin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.

					Yeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your
					groin, between your genitals and thighs.

					Other fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					How to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.

					Pat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Chafing
					How you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.

					The rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.

					How to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Pair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo
					How you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That
					moisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.

					How to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.

					If the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis
					How you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says
					Dr. Reichenberg.

					Contact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll
					usually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.

					You'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.

					How to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.

					If contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice
					How you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.

					You may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough
					to look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

					How to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Herpes
					How you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the
					blisters can break, leading to painful sores.

					If you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.

					How to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.

					There's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.

					Itchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts
					How you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than
					some itching, the warts don't feel like anything.

					How to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.

					Or, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.

					However, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.

				<ANSWER>A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main
					symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include
					Swelling in the abdomen
					Loss of appetite
					Nausea and vomiting
					Constipation or diarrhea
					Inability to pass gas
					Low fever
					Not everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms.

				<ANSWER>
					Muscle cramps can occur anywhere and in anyone; however, leg cramps are especially common in older people. Quinine is a medicine which has been used to treat cramps for many years. There is conflicting evidence for its ability to reduce cramps. Quinine can cause serious, even fatal adverse events,
					especially in overdosage.

					There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but
					no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.
					More research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps.

					The evidence is current to October 2014.

				<ANSWER>When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an
					infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.

					Scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All
					household members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried
					using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults
					usually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.

					Persons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.

					Rooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.

				<ANSWER>Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No "over-the-counter" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat
					scabies.
					Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as
					well as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who
					have had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.

			<ReferenceAnswer aid="TQ65A3">
				<ANSWER>
					Scabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed
					if new burrows and rash appear.

					Because scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.

					Medications commonly prescribed for scabies include:

					Permethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.
					Lindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or
					anyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).
					Crotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.
					Ivermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who
					weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).
					Although these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.

					Doctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications.

				<ANSWER>Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.

					The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.

					Glucose level can drop if:

					There is too much insulin in the blood. Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.
					The baby is not producing enough glucose.
					The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.
					The baby is not able to feed enough to keep the glucose level up.
					Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level causes symptoms or is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.

					Low blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:

					Born early, has a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery
					Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)
					Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy
					Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age

					If you have diabetes during pregnancy, work with your health care provider to control your blood sugar level. Be sure that your newborn's blood sugar level is monitored after birth.

				<ANSWER>What tests do doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis?

					Your doctor may use the following tests to help diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis:CT scan

					A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

					An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist reads and reports on the images. You don't need anesthesia for this procedure.

					For a CT scan, a health care professional may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. Contrast medium makes the structures inside your body easier to see during the procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes
					the x-rays. A CT scan of your colon is the most common test doctors use to diagnose diverticulosis and diverticulitis.

					Prevention
					To lower your chances of getting sick:

					Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.
					Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.
					Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.
					Use instant hand sanitizers to stop the spread of germs.
					Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.
					The immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:

					Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.
					DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.
					Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.
					Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.
					Eat yogurt that contains "active cultures." These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.

				<ANSWER>Supportive care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Compression garments-Your doctor may recommend that your child wear tight-fitting pieces of clothing on the affected limb to reduce pain and swelling. They can also help protect your child's limb from bumps and scrapes, which can cause bleeding.
					Heel inserts-If your child's legs are slightly different lengths (less than one inch difference), a heel insert can help your child walk normally.
					Anticoagulant therapy-One of the biggest potential risks of KTS is that a blood clot formed in the abnormal blood vessels may break off and make its way to your child's heart or lungs. Your doctor may recommend medications that thin your child's blood to help prevent blood clots from forming.
					Other medications-Your doctor may also recommend various pain medications and antibiotic medications for your child.
					Surgical care for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome

					Orthopedic Center-KTS can cause your child's foot or leg to become excessively large; in some cases your doctor may recommend an operation.
					An orthopedic surgeon can reshape your child's foot to help him fit it into a shoe.
					An orthopedic surgeon can perform a procedure called epiphysiodesis, which interrupts the growth plate and stops the leg from growing when it's reached a certain length.
					Other surgeries-Your doctor may recommend one of these other surgical procedures if your child's symptoms call for it.
					A surgeon can remove some of your child's excessive problematic veins.
					A surgeon can also help reduce the size of your child's affected limb with a debulking procedure, in which many of the abnormal vessels and some of the overgrown tissue is removed.
					Sclerotherapy -To help shrink and eliminate your child's abnormal veins in the affected area, your doctor may propose the injection of an irritating solution, which causes the veins to collapse. One of our experienced interventional radiologists can perform this procedure.
					Laser therapy-Pulsed dye laser treatments can help lighten your child's capillary malformation (port wine stain). Laser treatment can also speed healing if your child's lesion begins to bleed.

				<COMMENT>Boston Childrens Hospital</COMMENT>
			</ReferenceAnswer>
			<ReferenceAnswer aid="TQ73A2">
				<ANSWER>There are many different treatment options for patients with KTS depending on your child's symptoms:

					Compression garments, like tight-fitting, elastic sleeves, supply blood flow back to the heart (chronic vein insufficiency). They prevent lymphedema and recurrent bleeding from capillary or venous malformations of the limb. They also protect the limb from trauma. Learn more about compression garments
					(PDF).
					Pain medicine, antibiotics and elevating the limb to manage swelling.
					Medicines to prevent blood clotting (anticoagulant therapy).
					Heel inserts or surgery may be considered when one leg is longer than another.
					Your child may be referred to an orthopedic specialist to help develop a treatment plan.
					Laser therapy to lighten the color of the port wine stain, treat pain or help ulcers or open sores heal.
					Sclerotherapy (SCLAIR-oh-THAIR-uh-pee) to block unneeded veins.
					Some patients with KTS need surgery. This includes:

					Vein ligation: Clamping off a section of veins to prevent blood flow through a damaged section. It promotes blood flow through veins that are not damaged.
					Vein stripping: Using a metal wire to remove swelling inside a damaged vein.
					Vein resection: Removing a section of veins from the body.

				<ANSWER>Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females
					(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.
					Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each
					cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than
					females.
					In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of
					a gene in each cell have mutations.

			<ReferenceAnswer aid="TQ75A2">
				<ANSWER>
					Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.

					Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene
					(as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females.

					If a father has the mutated X-linked gene:
					all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome)
					none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome)
					If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.

					Less commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner.

				<ANSWER>MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that affects an enzyme involved in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine.[1][2][3] C677T and A1298C are two very common MTHFR gene changes.

					People with MTHFR gene mutations may develop elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocystinuria). Risks for health effects vary depending on the levels of homocysteine.[5]

					High homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations such as C677T and A1298C. Elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use
					of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin).[13][14]

					It is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate health risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate
					(5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered.[3][13] Speak to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your nutrition or need for vitamin supplementation.

				<ANSWER>
					Outlook (Prognosis)
					Although no cure exists for homocystinuria, vitamin B therapy can help about half of people affected by the condition.

					If the diagnosis is made in childhood, starting a low-methionine diet quickly may prevent some intellectual disability and other complications of the disease. For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.

					People whose blood homocysteine levels continue to rise are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause serious medical problems and shorten lifespan.

					Possible Complications
					Most serious complications result from blood clots. These episodes can be life-threatening.

					Dislocated lenses of the eyes can seriously damage vision. Lens replacement surgery may be needed.

					Can vitamin D be harmful?
					Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can
					also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of

				<ANSWER>
					1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a
					malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.
					Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.

					2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as
					malignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.

					In addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.

					3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.
					The median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for
					males (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death
					included respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or
					overwhelming infections (TABLE 6). To further examine the mortality of this cohort, we
					compared those with known long term follow-up, 226 females (48%) and 185 males (39%)
					to age-matched population controls. The survival of both male (p=0.0001) and female
					(p=0.0001) CVID subjects was significantly reduced as compared to 1994 United States
					reference information.34 (FIGURE 1) The risk of death in this interval was nearly 11 times
					higher for CVID patients with one or more of the non-infectious complications, than for
					subjects who had infections only (HR=10.96; p=0.0001) (TABLE 7). Kaplan-Meier Analysis
					confirmed this observation, with a long term survival of 95% for patients without versus 42%
					for those with non-infectious complications (FIGURE 2). These data agree with a previous
					study on CVID subjects from the ESID registry.7
					However, we found here that not all complications were associated with reduced survival. Patients with gastrointestinal disease
					(HR 2.78; p=0.0004), liver disease/hepatitis (HR 2.48; p=0.0003), lymphoma (HR 2.44;
					p=0.001), chronic lung disease including radiological and/or functional lung disease as
					described above (HR 2.06; p=0.001), or malabsorption (HR 2.06; p=0.022) had reduced
					survival in this interval, as compared to CVID patients without these particular complications.
					In contrast, patients with any of the autoimmune conditions, cancers other
					than lymphoma, history of splenectomy, presence of granulomatous disease, or the
					development of bronchiectasis alone, did not have significantly reduced survival over the 4
					decades of study.

				<ANSWER>
					Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common
					type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting
					type 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.

				<ANSWER> 1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium.
					2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption.
					3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: "Adequate calcium throughout life, as

					3. The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, including type I, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma. Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to
					the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height.

					Other types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma. Additional features of these conditions can include blue sclerae, short stature, hearing loss, respiratory problems, and a disorder of tooth
					development called dentinogenesis imperfecta. The most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, particularly type II, can include an abnormally small, fragile rib cage and underdeveloped lungs. Infants with these abnormalities have life-threatening problems with breathing and often die shortly
					after birth.

					4. Symptoms of EDS include:

					Back pain
					Double-jointedness
					Easily damaged, bruised, and stretchy skin
					Easy scarring and poor wound healing
					Flat feet
					Increased joint mobility, joints popping, early arthritis
					Joint dislocation
					Joint pain

			<ReferenceAnswer aid="TQ88A1">
				<ANSWER> 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia
					associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.


					2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and
					sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.



					3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome
					architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous
					recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.

				<ANSWER>
					1. Smoking has been found to increase the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas. Research suggests that smoking may also increase the risk of cancers of the liver, colon, and rectum.
					Smoking increases the risk of heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
					Smoking increases the risk of peptic ulcers.
					Smoking may worsen some liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
					Current and former smokers have a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease than people who have never smoked.
					People who smoke are more likely to develop colon polyps.
					Smoking increases the risk of developing pancreatitis.
					Some studies have shown that smoking may increase the risk of developing gallstones.

					2. Epidemiological and experimental evidence have shown that nicotine has harmful effects on the gastric mucosa. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking or nicotine adversely affect the gastric mucosa have not been fully elucidated. In this report, clinical and experimental data are reviewed.
					The effects of nicotine from smoking on gastric aggressive or defensive factors are discussed. Nicotine potentiates gastric aggressive factors and attenuates defensive factors; it also increases acid and pepsin secretions, gastric motility, duodenogastric reflux of bile salts, the risk of
					Helicobacter pylori infection, levels of free radicals, and platelet-activating factor, endothelin generation, and vasopressin secretion. Additionally, nicotine impairs the therapeutic effect of H2-receptor antagonists and decreases prostaglandin synthesis, gastric mucosal blood flow, mucus
					secretion, and epidermal growth factor secretion. Although many of the studies provide conflicting results, the bulk of the evidence supports the hypothesis that nicotine is harmful to the gastric mucosa.

				<ANSWER> 1. Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have "tender points" on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.

					People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as

					Trouble sleeping
					Morning stiffness
					Headaches
					Painful menstrual periods
					Tingling or numbness in hands and feet
					Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called "fibro fog")

					2. Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common when the person also:

					Is overweight
					Has a blood clot in the leg
					Is older
					Has a leg infection
					Has veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart
					Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.

					Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.

					Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.

					Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.

					Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:

					Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics
					Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers
					Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone
					Steroids

				<ANSWER> A healthy person cannot "catch" cancer from someone who has it. There is no evidence that close contact or things like sex, kissing, touching, sharing meals, or breathing the same air can spread cancer from one person to another.

					Cancer cells from one person are generally unable to live in the body of another healthy person. A healthy person's immune system recognizes foreign cells and destroys them, including cancer cells from another person.

					If you have some of the signs and symptoms of liver cancer, your doctor will try to find if they are caused by liver cancer or something else.

					Medical history and physical exam
					Imaging tests: Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Angiography

					Needle biopsy: A hollow needle is placed through the skin in the abdomen and into the liver. The skin is first numbed with local anesthesia before the needle is placed. Different-sized needles may be used.

					Laparoscopic biopsy: Biopsy specimens can also be taken during laparoscopy. This lets the doctor see the surface of the liver and take samples of abnormal-appearing areas.

					Surgical biopsy: An incisional biopsy (removing a piece of the tumor) or an excisional biopsy (removing the entire tumor and some surrounding normal liver tissue) can be done during an operation.

				<ANSWER> 1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).

					2. Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).

					The term "endocarditis" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.

					IE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.

					IE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.

					Overview

					IE mainly affects people who have:

					Damaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves
					Congenital heart defects (defects present at birth)
					Implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
					People who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.

					Certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection.

			<ReferenceAnswer aid="TQ97A1">
				<ANSWER> 1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal
					events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.

					Syncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss
					of consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar
					stroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent
					of syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.

					2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events. The most common TIA
					mimics are seizures, migraines, metabolic disturbances, and syncope. Mimics are more likely with gradual onset of symptoms and with nonspecific symptoms (Table 113), such as memory loss or headache.

				<ANSWER>Antidepressants most likely to cause sexual side effects include:

					Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and sertraline (Zoloft).
					Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).
					Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and clomipramine (Anafranil).
					Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). However, selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that you stick on your skin as a patch, has a low risk of sexual side effects.
					If you're taking an antidepressant that causes sexual side effects, your doctor may recommend one of these strategies:

					Waiting several weeks to see whether sexual side effects get better.
					Engaging in sexual activity before taking an antidepressant if your antidepressant requires a once-a-day dose.
					Adjusting the dose of your antidepressant to reduce the risk of sexual side effects. But always talk with your doctor before changing your dose.
					Switching to another antidepressant that may be less likely to cause sexual side effects.
					Adding a second antidepressant or another type of medication to counter sexual side effects. For example, the addition of the antidepressant bupropion or the anti-anxiety medication buspirone may ease sexual side effects caused by an antidepressant.
					Adding a medication to improve sexual function, such as sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). Although these medications are used to treat sexual problems in men, initial research suggests sildenafil may also improve sexual problems caused by
					antidepressants in some women.
